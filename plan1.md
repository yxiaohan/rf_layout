Below is a detailed plan to implement a Python library that converts a well-defined, human-readable YAML file describing RFIC (Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit) designs into a GDSII file suitable for simulation. The plan is broken down into clear, actionable steps to guide you through the development process systematically.

---

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Understand the Input and Output Formats
To begin, familiarize yourself with the two key file formats involved:

- **YAML File**: A human-readable data serialization format that will describe the RFIC design. It includes components (e.g., transistors, capacitors), their parameters (e.g., width, value), connections between them, and layout details (e.g., position, layer).
- **GDSII File**: A binary format widely used in the semiconductor industry to represent planar geometric shapes for mask layout data, which simulation tools can process.

Your library will act as a bridge, translating the YAML design specification into GDSII geometry.

---

### 2. Define the YAML Schema
Design a clear and structured YAML schema to represent the RFIC design. This schema will serve as the contract between the user and your library, ensuring all necessary information is provided. Key elements include:

- **Components**: Supported RFIC elements like transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, etc.
- **Parameters**: Component-specific attributes (e.g., width, length for transistors; value for capacitors).
- **Connections**: How components are wired together (e.g., nets or port connections).
- **Layout Information**: Spatial data such as coordinates (x, y) and layer assignments.

Here’s an example YAML structure:

```yaml
design:
  name: "MyRFIC"
  components:
    - type: "transistor"
      name: "Q1"
      parameters:
        width: 10
        length: 0.5
      position: [0, 0]
      layer: "active"
    - type: "capacitor"
      name: "C1"
      parameters:
        value: 1pF
      position: [10, 10]
      layer: "poly"
  connections:
    - from: "Q1.drain"
      to: "C1.terminal1"
```

Define this schema explicitly in your documentation to guide users.

---

### 3. Parse the YAML File
Implement functionality to read and validate the YAML input:

- **Use PyYAML**: Install the `PyYAML` package (`pip install pyyaml`) to parse the YAML file into a Python dictionary.
- **Validation**: Check that the YAML adheres to your schema, ensuring required fields (e.g., component type, position) are present and correctly formatted.

Example code:

```python
import yaml

def load_yaml(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    # Add validation logic here (e.g., check for 'design' key, required fields)
    if not data or 'design' not in data:
        raise ValueError("Invalid YAML: 'design' section missing")
    return data['design']
```

---

### 4. Create a Component Library
Build a set of Python classes or functions to model RFIC components and generate their GDSII representations:

- **Component Classes**: Define a class for each component type, encapsulating its parameters and layout logic.
- **GDSII Generation**: Each class should have a method to produce GDSII elements (e.g., polygons, paths) based on its parameters.

Example:

```python
class Transistor:
    def __init__(self, name, width, length, position, layer):
        self.name = name
        self.width = width
        self.length = length
        self.position = position
        self.layer = layer

    def to_gds(self):
        # Placeholder for GDSII geometry creation
        # Use a library like gdspy to define shapes
        pass

class Capacitor:
    def __init__(self, name, value, position, layer):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value
        self.position = position
        self.layer = layer

    def to_gds(self):
        # Placeholder for GDSII geometry creation
        pass
```

Instantiate these classes based on the parsed YAML data.

---

### 5. Handle Connections and Nets
Develop logic to process the `connections` section of the YAML:

- **Net Management**: Track which component ports (e.g., "Q1.drain") connect to others.
- **Routing**: Generate GDSII paths or shapes to represent these connections, possibly assigning them to specific layers.

Example approach:

```python
def process_connections(connections, components):
    # Map component names to objects
    comp_dict = {c.name: c for c in components}
    for conn in connections:
        from_comp, from_port = conn['from'].split('.')
        to_comp, to_port = conn['to'].split('.')
        # Logic to create GDSII paths between comp_dict[from_comp] and comp_dict[to_comp]
```

---

### 6. Generate the GDSII File
Use a Python GDSII library like `gdspy` (`pip install gdspy`) to create the output file:

- **Setup**: Create a GDSII library and cell to hold the design.
- **Add Elements**: Iterate over components and connections, adding their GDSII representations.
- **Save**: Write the result to a `.gds` file.

Example:

```python
import gdspy

def generate_gds(design_data, output_file):
    # Create GDSII library and cell
    lib = gdspy.GdsLibrary()
    cell = lib.new_cell(design_data['name'])

    # Instantiate components
    components = []
    for comp_data in design_data['components']:
        if comp_data['type'] == 'transistor':
            comp = Transistor(comp_data['name'], comp_data['parameters']['width'],
                              comp_data['parameters']['length'], comp_data['position'],
                              comp_data['layer'])
        elif comp_data['type'] == 'capacitor':
            comp = Capacitor(comp_data['name'], comp_data['parameters']['value'],
                             comp_data['position'], comp_data['layer'])
        components.append(comp)

    # Add component geometries to cell
    for comp in components:
        gds_elements = comp.to_gds()
        cell.add(gds_elements)

    # Handle connections (add routing geometries)
    process_connections(design_data['connections'], components)

    # Write to file
    lib.write_gds(output_file)
```

---

### 7. Implement Layout Rules and Constraints
Ensure the generated GDSII file is manufacturable:

- **Design Rules**: Add checks for minimum spacing, width, or other constraints specific to RFIC processes.
- **DRC Integration**: Optionally integrate with external design rule checking (DRC) tools or implement basic checks within your library.

Example:

```python
def check_design_rules(components):
    for i, comp1 in enumerate(components):
        for comp2 in components[i+1:]:
            distance = ((comp1.position[0] - comp2.position[0])**2 +
                        (comp1.position[1] - comp2.position[1])**2)**0.5
            if distance < MIN_SPACING:  # Define MIN_SPACING as a constant
                raise ValueError(f"Components {comp1.name} and {comp2.name} violate spacing rule")
```

---

### 8. Testing and Validation
Verify your library works correctly:

- **Test Cases**: Create sample YAML files with known RFIC designs.
- **Validation**: Generate GDSII files and inspect them using viewers (e.g., KLayout) or simulation tools to confirm accuracy.

Example test:

```python
design = load_yaml('test_design.yaml')
generate_gds(design, 'test_output.gds')
# Manually or programmatically verify test_output.gds
```

---

### 9. Documentation and User Guide
Make your library user-friendly:

- **Schema Documentation**: Detail the YAML structure with examples.
- **Usage Guide**: Provide installation instructions (`pip install pyyaml gdspy`), a quickstart, and sample code.

Example quickstart:

```python
from rfic_to_gds import generate_gds

design = load_yaml('my_design.yaml')
generate_gds(design, 'my_design.gds')
```

---

### 10. Advanced Features (Optional)
Enhance your library with additional functionality:

- **Parameter Sweeping**: Modify the YAML to support ranges (e.g., `width: [10, 20, 30]`) and generate multiple GDSII files.
- **Simulation Integration**: Add hooks to run simulations automatically after GDSII generation.
- **GUI**: Build a graphical interface for design entry and visualization.
